### Download and Categorize Subtitles

The primary purpose of this app is to download Youtube subtitles and categorize
each individual word into word classifications. 


The primary groups are:

1. modality
2. predicate group
3. word group
4. filter


The subtitle word is processed and give a: 

1. count (how many occurrences per video)
2. syllable count (per word)
3. length of word
4. frequency (how often the word is used over the course of the video)
5. group (each with sub group categories)
